# RadialProgressOverlay

A radial progress bar can be used to visually represent progress towards completing a task or reaching a goal. It typically consists of a circular track, which represents the full amount of progress required, and a colored fill that represents the progress that has been made so far. The fill gradually fills up the track as the user gets closer to their goal.

If you're looking for a classic radial progress bar, you can easily find prebuilt packages and samples all over the web. However, for our current project, we required a slightly modified, animatable version of the progress bar. We call it a radial progress overlay, which can be utilized on top of any child content:
